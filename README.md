# Hosting My First App

This project uses Python to generate a simple "Hello World" output and hosts it online using GitHub Pages.

The Python script was run using OnlineGDB to create the output file, which is then deployed as a publicly accessible webpage.

This project demonstrates the basic concept of cloud hosting and how applications can be shared online.
